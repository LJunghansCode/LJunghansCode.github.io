  <p>How to cook a perfect steak of any thickness</p>

<h3 id="ingredients">Ingredients</h3>
<ul>

  <li>Butter (lots)</li>
  <li>salt and pepper</li>
  <li>optional: frozen tater tots</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="theory">Theory</h2>
<p>The “Reverse Sear” is a fundamentally sound technique for cooking steak, and by far the most consistent in my opinion.</p>

<blockquote>
  <h4 id="this-method-at-its-core-has-two-steps"><em>This method at its core has two steps</em></h4>
  <blockquote>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring steak to a bit below final temp.</li>
      <li>Sear to finish.</li>
    </ol>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Now this isn’t unlike most steak methods, although sometimes the order is swapped. The reason I like the order of oven first is I feel more in control of the cook. The steak is brought to temperature in the oven, and finished in the pan.</p>

<p>The difference in the sear when the flesh goes on the pan warm and flexible means the meat can really hug the pan with maximum surface area, creating a fantastic <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction">Maillard Reaction</a>.</p>

<p>While in the pan after an extremely hot sear on both sides, butter will be used to baste and flip, a technique worth mastering. Enjoy a beautifully crusted and cooked steak.</p>

  <h2 id="steps-to-practice">Steps to practice</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Get the oven preheated to 260f. Bring your steak out of the fridge. (Don’t try this on frozen steak)</li>
    <li>Put the steak in the oven and bring to an internal temp of 115 for a nice med rare.</li>
    <li>As the steak is coming close to being done, get a pan on the stove, preferably something that can really take heat and a smacking. Get it smokin’ hot. (I mean get your fan on, don’t open your apartment door and open your windows)</li>
    <li>Get the steak out of the oven, rest it for just a few minutes.</li>
    <li>Give the steak a light rubbing of a high smoke temp oil.</li>
    <li>Sear the steak for about 45 seconds on one side, shake it around a bit to ensure coverage, push on it. (don’t let weirdos scare you about pushing on your meat when cooking it, juices shall not be lost…).</li>
    <li>Flip the steak, cook about 45 seconds and throw a huge dab (like 3 tbsp) of butter into the pan.</li>
    <li>Tilt the pan towards you, pooling the butter at the bottom, and with a big spoon, baste the steak with the melted and hot butter.</li>
    <li>(If the butter starts burning because your beef is not melting enough fat, feel free to turn the heat down and baste the hot butter onto a side for a little bit.)</li>
    <li>Continually baste &amp; flip until you are satisfied with the crust.</li>
    <li>Rest and enjoy!</li>
  </ol>
