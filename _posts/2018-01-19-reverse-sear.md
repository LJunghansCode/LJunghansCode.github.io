> How to cook a perfect steak of any thickness

### Ingredients
   * 1 Steak (I used 9oz ribeye)
   * Butter (lots)
   * salt and pepper
   * optional: frozen tater tots
   
***
## Theory
The “Reverse Sear” is a fundamentally sound technique for cooking steak, and by far the most consistent in my opinion. 

> #### _This method at its core has two steps_
>>  1. Bring steak to a bit below final temp.
>>  2. Sear to finish.

Now this isn’t unlike most steak methods, although sometimes the order is swapped. The reason I like the order of oven first is I feel more in control of the cook. The steak is brought to temperature in the oven, and finished in the pan.  

The difference in the sear when the flesh goes on the pan warm and flexible means the meat can really hug the pan with maximum surface area, creating a fantastic [Maillard Reaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maillard_reaction).

While in the pan after an extremely hot sear on both sides, butter will be used to baste and flip, a technique worth mastering. Enjoy a beautifully crusted and cooked steak.

> ## Steps to practice
 0. Get the oven preheated to 260f. Bring your steak out of the fridge. (Don't try this on frozen steak)
 1. Put the steak in the oven and bring to an internal temp of 115 for a nice med rare. 
 2. As the steak is coming close to being done, get a pan on the stove, preferably something that can really take heat and a smacking. Get it smokin’ hot. (I mean get your fan on, don’t open your apartment door and open your windows)
3. Get the steak out of the oven, rest it for just a few minutes.
4. Give the steak a light rubbing of a high smoke temp oil. 
5. Sear the steak for about 45 seconds on one side, shake it around a bit to ensure coverage, push on it. (don’t let weirdos scare you about pushing on your meat when cooking it, juices shall not be lost...).
6. Flip the steak, cook about 45 seconds and throw a huge dab (like 3 tbsp) of butter into the pan.
7. Tilt the pan towards you, pooling the butter at the bottom, and with a big spoon, baste the steak with the melted and hot butter.
8. (If the butter starts burning because your beef is not melting enough fat, feel free to turn the heat down and baste the hot butter onto a side for a little bit.)
9. Continually baste & flip until you are satisfied with the crust. 
10. Rest and enjoy!
