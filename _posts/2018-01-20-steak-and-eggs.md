## Making Steak and Eggs

> Steak and eggs together is a classic dish, often served with too much gravy as seen below.

> The method involves lots of butter and a solid foundation for the technique of dipping meat in juices.

### Ingredients
   * 1 Steak (I used 9oz of sirloin)
   * 1 Egg 
   * 6 or so Mushrooms
   * 5 Tbsp Good Butter
   * 1/2 cup cream
   * flour for thickening the gravy
   * salt, pepper
   * Optional: Garlic and fresh Thyme for the basting butter
